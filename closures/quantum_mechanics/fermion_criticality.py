"""Fermion Quantum Criticality Far from Equilibrium — QM Domain.

Tier-2 closure mapping 12 configurations of a driven-dissipative fermionic
lattice system through the GCD kernel.  Motivated by Mittal, Zander, Lang,
and Diehl (2026), "Fermion quantum criticality far from equilibrium,"
Phys. Rev. X 16, 011069.  arXiv: 2507.14318.

The paper constructs a microscopic lattice model in which fermions undergo
an absorbing-to-absorbing state transition between two topologically distinct
dark states.  Starting from an interacting Lindbladian, they derive a
Lindblad-Keldysh field theory whose critical fermions couple to a bosonic
bath with hydrodynamic fluctuations from particle number conservation.
A two-component emergent symmetry — the fermionic dark-state symmetry
(FDSS) — protects the purity of the fermion state even in the presence of
the thermal bath.  The FDSS has no bosonic analogue: the antiunitary
component relies on the antisymmetry of fermionic wavefunctions.

In GCD terms: the FDSS is a two-channel integrity shield.  Both the global
U(1) channel and the antiunitary fermion channel must remain bounded away
from epsilon for IC to survive — *geometric slaughter* (Orientation section 3)
applies identically here.  A dead antiunitary channel (the bosonic limit)
collapses IC just as the dead color channel collapses hadron IC in
confinement (T3).  The critical point is a regime boundary crossing:
the Liouvillian gap vanishes, channels diverge, and the heterogeneity gap
spikes — but FDSS prevents the multiplicative collapse that would push
the system to a classical universality class.

*Ruptura est fons constantiae* — the dissipation is what makes the
dark-state protection structurally meaningful.

Channels (8, equal weights w_i = 1/8):
  0  dark_state_fidelity     — overlap with nearest dark state eigenmode [0,1]
  1  steady_state_purity     — Tr(rho^2) of the nonequilibrium steady state [0,1]
  2  liouvillian_gap         — spectral gap of the Liouvillian (normalized) [0,1]
  3  topological_index       — winding number of the dark state (normalized) [0,1]
  4  fdss_global             — strength of U(1) particle number conservation [0,1]
  5  fdss_antiunitary        — strength of antiunitary fermion dark-state symmetry [0,1]
  6  drive_dissipation_ratio — structured drive / thermal dissipation [0,1]
  7  bath_coupling_phase     — |arg(g)|/pi, quantum character of coupling [0,1]

12 entities across 4 categories:
  Dark states (3):         deep trivial, deep topological, near-critical dark
  Critical (3):            critical point, above-critical, below-critical
  Symmetry-broken (3):     broken antiunitary (bosonic limit),
                           broken global (no U(1)), fully broken (classical)
  Comparison systems (3):  equilibrium QCP, driven-dissipative bosonic (KPZ),
                           strong dissipation (fully mixed)

6 theorems (T-FQC-1 through T-FQC-6).
