"""Quantum Biosensor Closure — QM.BIOSENSOR.v1

Tier-2 domain closure mapping quantum sensing platforms to the GCD kernel.

Context: Quantum biosensors use quantum mechanical properties (electron spin
coherence, optical transitions, entanglement) to measure biological processes
at the cellular and sub-cellular level. The fundamental challenge is that the
biological environment — warm, wet, and chemically noisy — is structurally
hostile to quantum coherence.

This closure captures 12 quantum sensing platforms ranging from diamond NV
centers inside living cells to external vapor-cell magnetometers, and derives
structural theorems about the quantum-biological seam from Axiom-0.

Primary research context:
    McGuinness et al. (2011) Nat Nanotechnol 6:358 — NV nanoparticles in cells
    Kucsko et al. (2013) Nature 500:54 — NV temperature sensing in live cells
    Le Sage et al. (2013) Nature 496:486 — NV wide-field bio magnetic imaging
    Barry et al. (2016) PNAS 113:14133 — NV detection of action potentials
    Lesage et al. (2018) ACS Nano 12:5821 — NV nanoparticle intracellular review
    He et al. (2019) Nat Methods 16:1145 — NV nanodiamond in cell nucleus
    Zheng et al. (2022) Adv Sci 9:e2103938 — NV tracking ferritin iron
    Masuyama et al. (2023) npj Quantum Inf 9:9 — hBN spin defect biosensors
    Inam et al. (2024) PRX Quantum 5:010307 — NV spin relaxometry in cells
    Phys.org (2026) "Researchers use quantum biosensors to peer into cells' inner workings"

The six structural theorems derived here:
    T-QB-1: Biological-Interface Heterogeneity Law
            Intracellular platforms show C > 0.50 (high channel heterogeneity)
            due to the biological dephasing field killing coherence channels.
    T-QB-2: External-Intracellular Complementarity
            SERF/OPM and NV-nanoparticle platforms are structural complements:
            sensitivity and noise channels are dead in one, coherence channels
            in the other. This is a symmetry of the quantum-biological seam.
    T-QB-3: Surface-Recovery (Scale Inversion Analog)
            NV scanning probe (AFM tip) partially restores IC relative to NV
            nanoparticle by removing the biological medium — coherence channels
            revive when the probe is not embedded in biology.
    T-QB-4: Utility Gate as Regime Gate
            Regime label (Stable/Watch/Collapse) maps to measurement utility:
            Stable = established characterization, Watch = proof-of-concept
            biosensor, Collapse = emerging/pre-clinical intracellular platform.
    T-QB-5: Coupling-Coherence Trade-off
            target_specificity anti-correlates with coherence_time_norm across
            the catalog (Spearman ρ < -0.50): better biological coupling
            requires closer physical proximity to the biological environment,
            which increases decoherence.
    T-QB-6: Dead Channel Identity by Category
            The dominant IC-killer is category-specific:
            - Intracellular (NP, SiC, hBN): bio_noise_rejection is the dead channel
            - External (SERF, OPM): spatial_resolution is the dead channel
            Δ is similar in magnitude across categories but structurally opposite.

GCD structural identities (Tier-1 — verified by kernel):
    F + ω = 1         (duality     — exact by construction)
    IC ≤ F            (integrity bound)
    IC = exp(κ)       (log-integrity relation)

Channel normalization protocol:
    All channels normalized to [ε, 1-ε] = [1e-8, 1-1e-8].
    See SECTION 1 docstrings for operational definitions per channel.

# Primary focus: the breakthrough technology reported in
# "Researchers use quantum biosensors to peer into cells' inner workings"
# (phys.org, 2026) — NV-center nanodiamonds delivered intracellularly to
# track biochemical processes with quantum-level sensitivity.
#
# The structural story (via GCD kernel):
#   - Intracellular NV (nanoparticles) → Watch/Collapse regime due to
#     biological decoherence killing coherence_time_norm and bio_noise_rejection
#   - External sensors (SERF, OPM) → Watch/Collapse regime for different reason:
#     spatial_resolution is dead (external, can't localize to single cell)
#   - Surface probe (AFM-NV) → Watch/Stable: avoids biological decoherence
#     while maintaining resolution — the partial scale-inversion recovery
#   - Quantum dots → Watch: different channel structure (optical, not spin)
#
# The key GCD insight: the biological seam is a specific type of collapse.
# It is not that quantum biology is impossible — it is that the seam between
# quantum sensor and biological environment creates a definite measurable
# heterogeneity gap Δ = F − IC that quantifies the price of proximity to life.

    threshold (ω ≥ 0.30) for all platforms that operate within or adjacent
    to biological tissue. External sensors escape this regime by never

    This is a precision example of geometric slaughter (orientation §3):
    a single near-zero channel decimates the geometric mean IC while the
    arithmetic mean F remains elevated. The GCD verdict exposes a structural
    weakness that F (sensitivity) alone cannot reveal.

    Implication for biosensing: F is a misleading platform metric when one
